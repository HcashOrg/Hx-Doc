# Offline API

The data in a smart contract's 'storage' area can be queried through the contract interface. This will incur fees, and needs to wait for block packaging for results. For some simple query functions that do not involve consensus, the contract supports a local (offline) query interface. By querying local blockchain data, the current status of the contract is able to be accessed quickly, and does not incur fees.
