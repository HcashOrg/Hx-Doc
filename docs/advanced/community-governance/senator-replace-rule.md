As a part of the governance and operation of the HyperExchange chain, Citizens are involved in the replacement of Senators. The replacement process is as follows:

---

## Senator resignation and by-election

When a Senator wishes to resign, they are required to broadcast this information to the chain, and the Foundation will post an announcement of a Senator by-election. Any existing Senator has the right to initiate an application to appoint a new Senator, and this application will be converted to a proposal after receiving no less than 2/3 of signatures from existing Senators.
    
The by-election proposal for adding a new Senator will be voted for by Citizens, with the voting weight of a Citizen being determined by the proportion of their pledged assets. This proposal will then be passed after receiving 2/3 of Citizens votes.

An existing Senator has the right to initiate a proposal of resignation, which will go into effect after receiving consensus among at least 2/3 of Senators. When the proposal is validated, the previous Senator will officially no longer be a part of the community governance process and they will be replaced by a new Senator. All collateral originally deposited by that Senator will also be returned at this point.

## Deposition and Supplementation of an Incompetent Senator

If it is found that a Senator has conducted any incompetent behaviour, any existing alternative Senator has the right to initiate an application to replace them. Once this process has been initiated and after receiving at least 2/3 of signatures from existing Senators, the application will convert into a proposal. From here, this proposal to eject the Senator will be voted for by Citizens, with their voting weight determined by the proportion of their pledged assets. This proposal will then be passed after receiving no less than 2/3 of Citizens votes.
    
After this, the Foundation will launch a Senator supplementation campaign announcement. At this stage any existing Senator has the right to initiate an application to appoint a new Senator, with the application being converted to a proposal after receiving at least 2/3 of signatures from existing Senators. The proposal for electing a new Senator is voted for by Citizens, with their voting weight determined by the proportion of their pledged assets. This proposal will then be passed after receiving no less than 2/3 of Citizens votes.

Once the replacement and election stages have been accepted at each level, the incompetent Senator will be dismissed, and the new Senator will be formally appointed.

## Adding a new Senator

If there are less than 15 elected Senators in the network, an application for electing a new Senator can be initiated at any time by any existing Senator. All new Senators entering the network will need to place a deposit of 500,000 HC tokens as a collateral deposit to ensure compliance. After an application has been initiated, it must receive no less than 2/3 of signatures from existing Senators to convert into a proposal. From here, this proposal is voted for by Citizens, with their voting weight determined by the proportion of their pledged assets. This proposal will then be passed after receiving no less than 2/3 of Citizens votes.

If the vote fails, the collateral deposit will be returned within 24 hours.

## The rules regarding replacing a Senator are as follows:

*	Each Senator replacement request requires a minimum interval of 25,000 blocks to initiate. Each Senator replacement request unconditionally resets the Senator replacement request interval.
*	The number of Senator changes cannot exceed 1/5 of the current number of Senators.
*	New Senator information must be provided and proposed adjustments must be made within 10,000 blocks of a replacement interval.
*	Changes and replacements relating to Senators will be effective after 10,000 blocks.
*	After proposing to replace a Senator, a new multi-signature wallet will be created and controlled only by new and existing Senators, before being broadcasted in the HyperExchange to reach consensus. All assets will be transferred from original Senators to this newly created hot and cold multi-signature wallet address via consensus. The previous wallet will be discarded after 20,000 confirmations, with any new assets sent to it being directly transferred to the current wallet.
