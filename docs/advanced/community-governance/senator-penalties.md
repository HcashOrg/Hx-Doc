In extreme cases, the collateral deposit paid by a Senator will be used to cover asset losses, including, but not limited to the following:

If a Senator delays a signature and affects the efficiency of the system, any existing alternative Senator has the right to initiate the process to replace them, which after being passed will result in the return of their collateral deposit, however, the network will confiscate all additional proceeds earned by that specific Senator;

If a Senator loses any private key, which compromises any part of the system, any existing alternative Senator has the right to initiate the process to replace them, and their collateral deposit will be forfeited according to the severity of the losses.

If it is confirmed that a Senator has deliberately compromised the security of the system, any alternative existing Senator has the right to initiate the process to replace them, and their collateral deposit will be forfeited according to the severity of the losses.

In the extreme case of a loss of assets, all current Senators collateral deposits can be used to cover these losses.
