Senators are responsible for the ongoing management of the HyperExchange chain. Their duties include modifying parameters and processing fees through consensus, changing the minimum amount of required pledged assets from Citizens, and modifying the amount of collateral that a Senator needs to deposit when a new asset chain is being linked via consensus. 
Senators are responsible for the management of cross-chain assets. They manage these by creating hot and cold multi-signature wallets, with withdrawals not being approved until at least 2/3 of Senators reach consensus.

Senators will receive 20% of contractual withdrawal fees and 30% of block rewards.

In the event of an accident resulting in loss of assets - for example, loss of assets from a hot wallet, Senators will be required to compensate these losses.
