Senators manage assets and govern communities through a consensus mechanism. Citizens use that consensus mechanism to vote on whether or not to replace a Senator. The interests of the two parties are aligned and they maintain each other, ensuring optimal network security and stability.

The entire network is governed by a consensus mechanism containing no more than 15 Senator nodes, which ensures efficiency in decision making.

The interests of Senators are closely related to the interests of the community. Senators are rewarded with incentives and benefits provided through the HyperExchange ecosystem. However, there is a high threshold for becoming a Senator, and a considerable amount of assets must first be pledged. Additionally, in the event of a loss of assets on the network, part of, or all collateral deposits from Senators will be used to cover these losses, ensuring accountability, and an alignment of interests.
