Each new asset blockchain is linked by using a plug-in mode. Ordinary nodes can choose whether to mount cross-chain plugins. Citizens and Senators are forced to mount all cross-chain plugins.
Each time a new cross-chain plugin is added, the process is as follows:

1.	Citizens and Senators negotiate a downtime of the network;

2.	Citizens and Senators restart and load plugins in batches, within the agreed time;

3.	All Senators must increase their collateral deposit to a pre-defined amount;

4.	After reaching an agreed time, an initialisation operation of the new token type is executed (this process involves creating new multi-signature addresses, broadcasting to the network new parameters related to the new token implementation and deciding upon a settlement price);

5.	Conduct the blockchain update;

6.	An ordinary node may decide to mount any new cross-chain plugin they desire. (Any ordinary node can select whichever cross-chain plugin they would like to mount. This is an independent process, unaffected by the consensus mechanism)
