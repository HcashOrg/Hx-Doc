## What is HyperExchange?
HyperExchange is designed to help the HCASH ecosystem achieve value through connecting blockchains together. Through injecting resources into its ecosystem from its developers and integrating resources from other chains, HyperExchange is able to build an 'interlinked, bifocal' dual-token and dual-chain ecosystem with HyperCash (HC) acting as the HCASH main chain, and the HyperExchange (HX) focusing on expanding the HCASH ecosystem. HyperExchange will enable accessibility among blockchain and non-blockchain networks, and will provide HC holders with benefits such as an increased weight of mining and more administrative decision-making power within the network. Besides cross-chain functionality, HyperExchange will have Turing Complete smart contract [5] functionality. In a cross-chain application scenario, the underlying blockchain virtual machine, and the SDK and RPC support multiple development languages, providing required flexibility configuration and the ability to exchange multiple assets.

Together, HC and HX will help HCASH build an interlinked, bifocal, dual-chain ecosystem that is highly secure, private and interconnected.

## What is a Hshare chain?
As one of its dual chains, HyperCash functions as an upgraded Hshare chain, focusing on non-interoperable blockchain features, such as advanced post-quantum and Zero Knowledge Proof technologies. This whitepaper aims to introduce HyperExchange. All subsequent information relating to HyperCash can be found in the HCASH technical yellow paper.

## What is the Cross-chain?
HyperExchange will be the first system to achieve network interoperability using a Blockchain Multi Tunnel (BMT) protocol, HyperExchange Axis, Indicator, smart contracts and other blockchain innovations. HyperExchange lays the foundation for building cross-chain distributed commercial applications in its ecosystem.
